 Static Websites with Headless WordPress via REST API 
======================================================

Static websites are great but they still need some kind of content management system. And committing Markdown files to GitHub isn’t a friendly option for the majority of users including developers. So we end up using tools such as [Prose](http://prose.io/), [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for the editing interface, user authentication and handling the media files.

Usually it is only the WordPress PHP templating layer that bothers the proponents of static websites and is perceived as the performance bottleneck. However, we now have the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) which is way more flexible than any collection of Markdown files.

How?
----

1. Use WordPress REST API during the build process to create the content source files with the necessary front-matter.
2. Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) or any other build tool to actually construct the website.

There is even a [WordPress REST API client library for Node.js](https://github.com/WP-API/node-wpapi) which simplifies everything for Node based workflows and deployment setups.

Finally, a free website on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) can be used as a content library.

# Solutions WebriQ CMS is bringing to the to the table
### We have made a choice for you when it comes to Static Website Generators
**Spike**

Spike is very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.
Spike is a next-generation static site generator. It is built on top of webpack, and a foundation of html, css, and js parsers that accept plugins to transform the output. It’s fast, actively developed, and very data-friendly. Check out the quick introduction video below to get a feel for Spike!

***Why is WebriQ using Spike, and not Jekyll or Hugo?***

The short answer is because Spike was built very specifically for static site builds, so it's cleaner and better than general purpose build tools, since it's specialized to that purpose. The longer answer is that it's a qualitative thing. Much like people would ask "Why should I use snapchat when I can just text a photo" or "Why should I use slack when I already have hipchat?", there is no logical answer other than that the experience is different, and in my opinion, much better -- tailored exactly to what you need. So just try it, and you just might find that you really like it.


### We are offering you a GIT Based CMS system with a Complete User Interface

**[WebriQ CMS](http://app.webriq.com)** is bridging the GAP between Static Site Generators and Flat File CMS Systems. 
The days when a brand only needed one website to house its online presence are long gone. Today, webinars, events, pop-up shops and product promotions all require their own microsites or landing pages. 
When we moved into what some call the post-CMS landscape, the usage of static site generators and Flat-file CMS and Static Site Generator functionality overlaps in many ways ; so how do you choose between the two? 

When we moved into what some call the [post-CMS landscape](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/), the usage of static site generators (SSGs) and flat-file CMS for these microsites (and at times for lightweight corporate sites), grew. And now, with the headless CMS hype in full flow, the interest in these front-end solutions is returning.

After listing the [best flat-file CMS](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-flat-file-cms-options-for-lean-website-building/) and the [best static site generators](http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/15-static-site-generators-to-complement-your-headless-cms/) on offer — it’s time to formally identify what separates these two similar technologies.
