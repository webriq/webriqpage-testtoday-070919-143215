 So many factors go into the decision to buy or upgrade a web CMS: which should you focus on? PHOTO: Chloe RidgwayChoosing a web CMS is one of the biggest decisions a brand can make.

In 2017 and beyond, a content management system is no longer just the software you use to manage your website. Any CMS worth its weight is also able to leverage visitor behavior and data to shape customer journeys and deliver tailored content to multiple audiences across channels.

In short, a modern CMS is the primary link between a brand and its customers. Thus, it’s now more vital than ever to avoid [going home with a lemon](http://www.cmswire.com/web-cms/how-to-break-the-web-cms-replacement-cycle/).

The only problem is, how do you go about choosing the best CMS for your brand?

The Question
------------

What’s the most important factor in the decision to purchase a CMS? Is it price, functionality, architecture or something else?

The Answers
-----------

 While all of these factors are important to consider, we believe organizations should pay equally close attention to two additional factors.

First is omnichannel experience management, and how effectively is the organization able to produce and manage content for various channels. Not just web or mobile, but also social, IoTs, VR, AR, voice assistants and others.

The second one are the microservices architectures organizations need to consider when building future-proof digital marketing technology stacks. This can help organizations be flexible and agile in fulfilling complex business needs through seamless integration of multiple best-of-breed solutions.

 The most important factor that should be considered in the purchase of a CMS is the facilitation of contribution. The focus should be on the actual contributors and the usability of the platform. If it isn’t used properly, it could be a point of failure across the board.

 A well-designed CMS should enable the people who have their hands on the keyboard as they will always be your biggest success factors.

A flexible product is your best bet to minimize business disruptions required if you need to replace your “can-do-everything-you-need-today CMS” with whatever you need next year. Every organization needs a CMS. So the decision is not if you need one, but what you want or need to stay in business. If your chosen CMS makes it easy to innovate and adapt, provides an inspiring user interface to foster creation of great content and comes with the tools you need, backed by a passionate support and development team, you are off to a great start.

 As content marketing is driving business revenue, price should be irrelevant — it is value that matters. Content can come from many sources, including from the traditional notion of a CMS, but needs to be mixed, tagged, targeted, translated and generally turned into something useful. That is much harder than one might think.

You can get tons of free (as in “no license cost”) CMSs, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they help you win the innovation war. Functionality certainly is very important. Even though many CMS’s provide broadly speaking the same base functionality, the difference in what they were built for and how they perform in real life is massive.

The slightly unsatisfactory answer is that the most important factor is subjective to each individual organization based on their differing requirements, experience and technical skills.

Technical capabilities is the one factor we focus on. Have you considered the technical implications for your creative vision? Who is going to build it? Support it? Do you need all the bells and whistles — or is simplicity better? Starting from a solid technical spec increases the likelihood of success.

Certainly one of the least important factors is price. In life, some things are reassuringly expensive such as a child car seat or breakfast tea. In these cases price ensures the quality of the product, but it doesn’t guarantee the happiness of your child in transit or the enjoyment of your first meal of the day. Similarly, investing heavily in a complex CMS doesn't guarantee the success of a digital platform.

__While factors like price, functionality and architecture are important, the marketplace is now more experienced than ever before when it comes to content management systems.

Customers already know what they want and prefer to dig deeper into other aspects of the CMS, such as the product roadmap and strategy, customer success approach, and yes, even customer-vendor compatibility.
