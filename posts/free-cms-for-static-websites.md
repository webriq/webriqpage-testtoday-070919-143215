We just dumped our old web content management system of choice , got the hang of a static websites , and really like the simple, lightweight and maintenance-free feel of it…

Why on earth would I want to get a CMS for static websites?

A few reasons, you should consider a CMS for a static website; 
So that non-technical folks are also able to create content for static websites, without the need to go and consult a developer.
So that you can use static websites in lots more customer projects.
So that no developer is required to update the repository and run the site.

It just so happens that static site are mostly loved by developers, but not by the average Joe. They do not offer WYSIWYG,previewing on demo sites may take an update cycle, they are often based on markdown text files, and they require some knowledge of modern day repositories.

Moreover, when teams are collaborating, it can get complicated quickly. Has this article already been proof-read or reviewed? Is this input valid? Are user permissions available, e.g. for administering adding and removing team members? Can this article be published at a future date? How can a large repository of content be categorized,organized, and searched? All these requirements have previously been more or less solved within the admin area of your CMS. But of course with all the baggage that made you leave the appserver-app-database-in-one-big-blob stack in the first place.

## **Content API is one solution**
Decoupling the content management aspect from the web building system. And then replacing the maintenance prone server with a cloud based web service offering. Effectively, instead of your CMS ,you move to a [Content Management as a Service (CMaaS)](https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/content-as-a-service/) world, with a content API to deliver all your content. That way, you get the all the [benefits of content management features](http://www.digett.com/blog/01/16/2014/pairing-static-websites-cms) while still being able to embrace the static site generator mantra.



Systems like Prismic or Contentful are typically designed to be fast, scalable, secure, offer high uptime, so that you don’t have to worry about maintenance ever again.
Separates content from presentation, so you can reuse your content repository for any device platform your heart desires. That way, you can COPE ("create once, publish everywhere").
Offers webhooks that you can use to rebuild your static site in a fully automated fashion every time your content is modified.

On the not so positive site, the platforms are proprietary (as opposed to open source), do not come cheap, have a lot of complexity that more often not needed then needed and have a relatively high cost of ownership.

## **A better alternative is a [FREE CMS](http://app.webriq.com/auth/register) for your static website**

Deploy modern static websites with our automated open source platform. Add best practices like SSL, CDN distribution,and continuous deployment with a single click.

All elements of the platform are open sourced, so you are in full control of the website. The CMS interfaces with a Github repository through a simple User Interface, only containing the variable elements in the website, i.e. blogs, articles etc.

Each new content entry triggers a new build on the platform and ensures that your content updates are reflected on your site within seconds. All automated, and without the need of a developer and without the possibility to change the code on your website by mistake. 

All the content is safely stored in a Github public or private repository. You can revert to previous or go back later versions of the site by a single click. Last but not least you can assign different content editors to take of the content updates by inviting them as a team member.
