Two Paths
======================

There are essentially two famous techniques to take whilst making a decision to construct an internet site. You can go along with a static HTML internet site or a Content Management System (CMS) which include WordPress or Joomla. If you’re new to constructing and coping with web sites, then you might wonder what the huge difference is among these two tactics. They both make best websites, however, there may be an international of distinction on the way you get to the cease end result. Read onto discover the difference among them, and which one is really great for you.

### HTML – CSS – JavaScript

A static HTML website is one which you construct with HTML and CSS. The cause it’s referred to as a static internet site is because nothing can alternate about the website or as a minimum no longer except you go back and exchange the code. Up till latest years, this becomes honestly the only way to make a website. There is no dynamic content, neither is there any actual consumer interaction. The only factor you get is what you input into the HTML. What does that suggest? Simply placed, after you are performed with the design and installation the internet site it will most effective do what you requested it to. You can make stunning web sites that allow the users to examine the content material, purchase merchandise, access to unfastened gives, sign on for newsletters and build your listing. Just approximately something your choice you can do with a static HTML internet site.

Though it is known as an HTML internet site, there are absolutely several exceptional coding languages generally used to construct an HTML website. List of basic HTML tags presents the shape or the core, but CSS is used to set the appearance and feel for the visuals and to make an appearance pretty too. You can set the dimensions, colors, fonts, backgrounds… And many others. JavaScript may be used to feature computer graphics to the internet site and even a touch dynamic interplay with the user. As you can believe though, in case you pick out to go this direction to create your internet site you’ll want to recognize at least the basics of each of the languages used.


### WordPress or Joomla?

This is, in reality, a count of desire. Both are very good systems and for the maximum component, one is as clean to apply as the opposite. The biggest distinction among them is this: SEO WordPress has been around since 2003 and is very famous. As an end result, they get a huge amount of support from other programmers on the subject of Plugins (we’re going to talk about that is a minute) and search engine marketing, and there are a kazillion issues available for WordPress too, therefore making it a very popular desire for each rookies and pros alike. Joomla has not been around as long (2005) however has become very popular in its own right over the years. It is second handiest to WordPress and with over 30 million downloads and now with WordPress integration, it is no slouch. Both permit customers to depart comments to posts and or pages, circulate new content material from resources like social media or news websites and you could additionally quick add new posts to your blog without having to fear approximately editing your navigation bar (it’s computerized) or structuring your pages, thanks to built-in templates.

### Pros and Cons

Static HTML: Pros – A static HTML internet site is straightforward to setup (especially if you understand code). You have complete manipulate of the layout, appearance, and feel. HTML best websites also have a tendency to load faster due to the fact they usually have fewer documents and information to download. As said in advance, a large gain of HTML is that you have total manipulate over the internet site’s appearance. You can trade the visuals of a WordPress or Joomla website online too, but you’re restrained via the amount of choices or flexibility available with the topic or template you’re the usage of. If you realize CSS, that is a fairly easy language, then you could without difficulty alternate the way your HTML website seems.

Static HTML: Cons – The cons of static HTML deal with its lack of interactivity and their complex shape with large websites. An HTML page has surely no interactivity and it handiest consists of what you code. For instance, in case you code a Web page with an editorial, then this is all you may get. There can be not anything else at the web page except for that article. There might be no person content, no dynamic content that generates at the same time as you’re away and the website will stay static. On the other hand, in case your software it to consist of a database in order that customers can get entry to the information I bet in a sense you can name that a constrained shape of interactivity. The same holds actual with a shopping cart. A user comes on your internet site buy a products or services you provide; so in the identical experience, they could engage with your internet site in a restricted form.

WordPress Pros – As stated in advance – you could use WordPress or Joomla, but for assessment sake, we’re going to simplest seek advice from WordPress hereafter. WordPress is regularly taken into consideration the first-class manner to setup a website because it’s miles very clean to do and clean for inexperienced persons to parent out. A WordPress blog does make the effort to setup but not when you don’t forget how long it took someone to jot down all of the code required for an HTML web site. Besides, we’re actually talking hours, no longer days or even weeks, but it might no longer be out of the normal for an internet developer to spend days designing a new internet site the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Installing a WordPress blog most effective takes a few minutes with maximum hosts, and including a new theme takes even much less time and subject matters are what WordPress is all about.

Let’s take a minute to talk about topics. Themes or templates permit you to trade the appearance or feel of your website actually in minutes. If you want a particular area of interest web page as an example, a medical looking experience or a golfing theme there are masses to choose from. Some are unfastened and others you will need to buy, typically called Premium topics. If you just need a blog and a place for humans to go away remarks, then a unfastened theme will possibly do the trick. However, in case you want a greater expert or storefront look with maybe a buying cart or an information feed for an Amazon associate, then a top rate topic is the manner to move. I pick premium topics due to the fact they typically permit for greater flexibility and customization.

WordPress Cons – One of the problems with WordPress may be too many plugins. I’ve seen websites that take too long to load and it changed into resulting from having a manner to many plugins established on the web page. Only use what’s vital. Another factor to recollect is the issues. Some are sincerely better than others. Theme developers put plenty of time and idea into the design, but a few developers are certainly thinking of the give up-person greater than others and recognize that we want lots of customization freedom and greater importance, now not each person has programming talents so make it easy to understand and use. All of them allow for some customization, but others will provide you with greater manipulate and the ability to make your internet site appearance the way you actually need it’s. All I’m announcing is to read the critiques and do your homework earlier than making an investment in a top rate subject matter. Also, a well-designed subject matter will look clean and cargo speedy. There are heaps of issues to select from, so you are certain to discover something that you like.

# Solutions WebriQ CMS is bringing to the to the table
### We have made a choice for you when it comes to Static Website Generators
**Roots**

Roots is very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind.
Roots can handle a huge number of compiled languages, and can be used with many tools that help push static sites as far as possible. For example, it can link with an API, pull in your data, and render parts of it into your views on compile. Then it can render the same or other views as javascript templates and you can push any other data from your API into them on the fly at runtime on the client side in reaction to user actions. And that's just a small taste of its capabilities. You really can do a lot with static sites, and roots is here to push those limits.

***Why is WebriQ using Roots?***

The short answer is because roots was built very specifically for static site builds, so it's cleaner and better than general purpose build tools, since it's specialized to that purpose. The longer answer is that it's a qualitative thing. Much like people would ask "Why should I use snapchat when I can just text a photo" or "Why should I use slack when I already have hipchat?", there is no logical answer other than that the experience is different, and in my opinion, much better -- tailored exactly to what you need. So just try it, and you just might find that you really like it.
